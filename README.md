# Report for the School District Analysis

For this analysis we were asked by Maria to make another analysis because the school board has notified her that the file “students_complete.csv”, that we work previously, shows evidence of academic dishonesty in the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. The school board does not now the full extent of the academic dishonesty, but they want to uphold state-testing standards and asked to Maria and her team for help. 

For this purpose, she asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with the legend “NaNs” while we kept the rest of the data intact. Also, Maria wants to repeat the school district analysis that we did previously and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results: 
We reuse the code we develop before for the School District Analysis and made some adjustments to get the evidence of academic dishonesty in math and reading grades in the Thomas High School ninth graders asked by the school board.

First, they want to know how the district summary were affected by the changes asked by the school board, in the previous analysis we had a higher average math score and the percentage of math, reading and overall passing students. However, in the present analysis, these categories are slightly lower.

In contrast, the replace of data in the math and reading scores for the Thomas High School data affected the percentage of passing, while in the previous analysis the passing percentage in math, reading and overall were 93%, 97% and 90%, respectively. With the modifications, now the passing percentage is 67%, 70% and 65% for the same categories.

In the performance school comparative, we sort the data by Overall Passing, in this case, the replacing of information of the ninth graders of the Thomas High School does not have any modification in the top of the performance of the schools, the school remains in the second place in terms of performance.

After sawing the performance of the school, we continue with the analysis and now we want to know how replacing the ninth-grade scores affect some data of the school, first, the math and reading scores by grade, now the database does not have any information of the ninth graders of the school.

*Math grades*

*Reading grades*

In terms of school spending, we saw a difference of 0.10 percentage points in the range between $630-644 in the percentage of passing reading and the overall, the rest of the information remains the same.

By school size, we saw a difference in the school size medium (1000 – 1999) category with the percentage of passing reading of 0.10%, the rest of the information remains the same.

Finally, the replace of information does not change in the information by school type.

## Summary: 

After the replace of data in the math and reading scores for the Thomas High School asked by the school abroad, this was the main results:

-	The percentage of passing change, in the previous analysis the passing percentage in math, reading and overall were 93%, 97% and 90%, respectively. Now the passing percentage is 67%, 70% and 65% for the same categories.
-	In terms of school spending, we saw a difference of 0.10 percentage points in the range between $630-644 in the percentage of passing reading and the overall.
-	By school size, we saw a difference in the school size medium (1000 – 1999) of 0.10%, the rest of the information remains the same.
-	The replace of information does not change in the information by school type.
